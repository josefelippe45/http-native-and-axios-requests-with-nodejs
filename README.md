# http-native-and-axios-requests-with-nodejs
Working with native requests using http built-in modules, and using the Axios module with GET request. 


All the module used in this repository are built-in modules, so there's no need of installing any third-party libraries,
but the Axios uses a npm module and for that, you need to run npm install in the axios-module directory for the
project runs.
